CorporateAgendaClient
======================
* Corporate clients connect from their intranet application to a module named Agenda, displaying
events created by the client himself or by the administrator(and which are adressed to them).
* Each event is described by a begin date and hour, an end date and hour, a title, a priority
(important, urgent, info) and an author(the user, or admin).
* Events created by admin can also have an attached document(an image, pdf file, doc, etc.)
* Events created by user can only be viewed by himself
* A search engine is available, allowing the client to find events by a specific criteria : period of time,
 a priority , an author or a combination of them

* Each user can check the daily events by logging into the intranet application, but there is no
mechanism available to send event notifications to the client when he comes offline.

* Android client for Corporate agenda is therefore supposed to alert the user whenever an event is
being created, modified or canceled. 
* The application also may alert the user of an incoming event,
based on an interval he has chosen before.

* This application has been developed and designed together with my colleague Laura Costea.
* This application uses the following technologies Java REST Service, MySql Database, Android Services, Local Android Database (SQLLite).
* This application is  finalized in 65 %  percent .
* This  applications demonstrates knowledge of new technologies and teamwork.
