WHAT IS STOMP ?
------------------------
Stomp is the main server to who any player is connected. At this moment there are 2500 players that can connect.
Without Stomp the player can't update and can't interface with third party systems.

------------------------
WHY MAKE STOMP VERSION 2
------------------------
There are many problems with version 1, the production version:
	- Stomp is using only 1 connection to the database and only one thread that is reading notifications from the database.
	- Any database notification is treated one by one.
	- Any command received from a player is putted in a queue and processed one by one.
	
This architecture, without a connection pool to the database, without priority queues for commands, without multithreading produces the following problems in production:
	- Delay in notifying the jukebox (Timo)
	- Delay in the communication between the server and the players which make the players react abnormaly without justifications
	
	PS: Those delays are very obvious, friday night when there is a pick in the numbers of running players
	
-------------------------
NEW FEATURES IN VERSION 2
-------------------------
	- using a connection pool for database
	- using multithreaded execution of the commands and notifications.
	
	PS: because the actual code is not properly conceived to be multithreaded, a major refactor needs to be done.
	

-------------------------
ACTION LOG
-------------------------

28 may 2013
	- create an initial design for a multithreaded application
	- add read of the configuration

	- add connection pool library
	- add initialisation of pool and aquire a connection
	- add a layer to perform operations to database
	- add dao who returns busines objects
	
	- a lot more classes that maybe will be refactored in the future
