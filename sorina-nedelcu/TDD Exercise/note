We will look at the example of a class that represents a bank account.
The contract for the BankAccount class not only requires methods to get and set the bank account's balance, as well as methods to deposit and withdraw money.
It also specifies the following two conditions that must be ensured:

  - The bank account's initial balance must be zero.
  - The bank account's balance cannot become negative.
